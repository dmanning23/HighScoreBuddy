HighScoreBuddy
==============

HighScoreBuddy is a library for real simple saving and loading of local high score tables.

It uses the XNA and MonoGame libraries. It has currently tested in Windows and Ouya, but would be easy to use in any platform they support.

Note: This lib uses a couple of submodules, so make sure to run "git submodule init; git submodule update" after cloning.
